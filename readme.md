# Favicon

The favicon depicts [Zwolle railroad station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolle_railway_station) and its connections, arguably the most important hub for the Northern Netherlands (where I happen to live). Expressed in graph theory terminology, it is the node in the Dutch rail network with the [largest number of connected edges](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)>): 7.
